      "Dental implants are a proven solution for people in good overall oral and systemic health who have lost one or more teeth due to periodontal disease, trauma or injury, or any other reason. Dental implants are artificial tooth roots that are inserted into the jawbone to replace missing teeth. Dental Implants are one of the most predictable and conservative ways of replacing missing teeth with the best long term success. Dental Implants look, feel and function like natural teeth and can last a lifetime. Dental implants are available in several different forms. \n\n The most common dental implants are called “root form implants”. Root form implants are similar to teeth in that they mimic roots of teeth.Sometimes a full set of teeth are carried by a denture and held in place securely by implants. When you visit us at Dr. Ersoy Dental clinic, your dentist can advise what is right for you.",

    name: "Wisdom Tooth Extractions",
    description:
      "Wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt within the mouth. When they align properly and gum tissue is healthy, wisdom teeth do not have to be removed. Unfortunately, this does not generally happen. The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting within the mouth. This could cause pain, infection and other issues. In most cases, the extraction of wisdom teeth is performed under local anesthesia. All options will be discussed with you before the procedure is performed. Once the teeth are removed, the gum is sutured. To help control bleeding, bite down on the gauze placed in your mouth. You will rest under our supervision in the office until you are ready to go home. Upon discharge, your postoperative kit will include postoperative instructions, a prescription for pain medication, antibiotics, and a follow-up appointment in one week for suture removal. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call us.",
